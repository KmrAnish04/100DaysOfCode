    Algorithm:
        GFG Algorithm:
            Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear 
            ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u 
            comes before v in the ordering. So, to find the Topological sorting for a graph, 
            we just have to find in-degrees of each vertex and order the nodes from least in-degree 
            to the highest.

            Algorithm to find Topological Sorting: 
            We recommend to first see the implementation of DFS. We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting of a graph. 
            In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. 
            In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, we first recursively 
            call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of the stack. 
            Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the stack.
